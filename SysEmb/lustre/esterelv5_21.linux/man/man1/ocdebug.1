.SH NAME
ocdebug, sscdebug \- Esterel and Lustre Debug code producers \-
Version v5_21
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ocdebug
[options] file ...
.sp
.B sscdebug
[options] file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBocdebug\fP (resp. \fBsscdebug\fP) code producer takes as input
one or more \fBoc\fP (resp. \fBssc\fP) files and produces a human
readable output.
If there is no input file, the standard input is read.
Typical use is: 
.sp
.RS
.B ocdebug < game.oc
.RE
.sp
or 
.sp
.RS
.B ocdebug -B game game.oc
.RE
.sp
or 
.sp
.RS
.B ssccdebug -B game game.ssc
.RE
.LP
The following options are interpreted by \fBocdebug\fP and
\fBsscdebug\fP:
.IP \fB-names\fP 10
Print the signal and task names after each action
involving them. Between square brackets for each present signal test;
between braces for each output action;
between brackets for task names.
.IP \fB-var_names\fP 10
Use the real names of variables instead of the ones automatically
generated by \fBocc\fP when printing the action table. This option is
useful when actions are equations of a single-state automaton.
.IP \fB-halts\fP 10
Print the haltset of each state of the automaton after the keyword:
\fBhaltset\fP (only useful for \fBocdebug\fP).
.IP \fB-emitted\fP 10
Print the list of output or local signals emitted in each 
transition of the automaton or in each equation, after the keyword:
\fBemitted\fP.
.IP \fB-tasks\fP 10
Print the status of active tasks in each transition of the automaton
or in each equation, after the keywords: \fBstarted\fP, \fBkilled\fP,
\fBsuspended\fP, \fBactivated\fP.
.IP \fB-tables\fP 10
Print only module tables; do not print the automaton nor the
equations.
.IP \fB-latex\fP 10
Produce an output file for LaTeX.
.IP \fB-simul\fP 10
Use the same action numbers as the ones in code suited to
interactive simulations.
.IP "\fB\-B\fP \fBname\fP" 10
Specify an output file base name.
The suffix ".debug" (or ".tex" when the option \fB-latex\fP is set) is
added automatically.
If this option is omitted the output code is printed in file
\fBocdebug_out.debug\fP (or \fBocdebug_out.tex\fP).
.IP "\fB\-D\fP \fBdirectory\fP" 10
Specify  a directory where the output file will be placed.
The default is the current directory.
.IP \fB-v\fP 10
Verbose mode: print the name of each input module on the standard
error stream.
.IP \fB-stat\fP 10
Print statistics on the standard error stream: the execution time and
the process size.
Implemented on BSD 4.x systems only.
.IP \fB-s\fP 10
Silent mode. No output file is generated.
.IP \fB-oc\fP 10
Read \fBoc\fP format and produce human readable automata.
This is the default option.
.IP \fB-ssc\fP 10
Read \fBssc\fP format and produce human readable equations.
.IP \fB-version\fP 10
Print the version name on the standard error output stream
and terminate, ignoring all other arguments.
.IP \fB-access\fP 10
Print access rights to the processor on the standard error output
stream and terminate, ignoring all other arguments.
.IP \fB-info\fP 10
Print various informations about the processor compilation on the
standard error output stream and terminate, ignoring all other
arguments.
