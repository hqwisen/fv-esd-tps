Here are some examples of Lustre programs (see README files in each directory):

minus contains a very small verification program, together with an
      example of session. It may be the first example to try.

uturn contains a complete verification program for the example illustrating
      our paper in SIGSOFT'91.

parity illustrates the use of arrays and recursive nodes.
