Web :
=====

   Webs are elliptic shaped nodes gathering multiple connections
including more than two ports (simple connections can be represented
by a plain edge between ports).

   Examples are:
  Lotos multisynchronisations,
  Synchronisation vectors of automata, 
  Petri nets transitions, etc.

Webs can be connected though edges to ports or vertices.

   How to create a web:
1- select the <GraphicObjects>:<Webs>:<Create> menu button,
   ('w' for keyboard short-hand).
2- click with the mouse left button inside drawing area.

   Vertex size attributes can be fixed by resources :
          atg*webRadiusHoriz: 12
          atg*webRadiusVert:  2
          atg*webLineWidth:   0 (0 uses fast raster)
