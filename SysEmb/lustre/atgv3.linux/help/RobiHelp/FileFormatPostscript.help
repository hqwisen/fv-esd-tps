 Autograph produces Postscript output, with a slightly more polished
look than on screen (due to spline mostly). Fonts used in Postscript
may differ from the ones on screen, so resources must provide both
wherever needed. Postscript fonts sizes are not guaranteed to match
screen sizes.

WARNING: Color Postscript is not implemented. Postscript files may NOT
be read back into Autograph.
