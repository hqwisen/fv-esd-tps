  Autograph allow objects selection (with the mouse right button, see
<Help>:<on mouse button>), or label selection (with the <Label>:<Select>
menu button). 

Selected objects can be relatively placed, so that they would coincide:

<Placing>:<Align>:<Left>      in a left-adjusted column
<Placing>:<Align>:<Right>     in a right-adjusted column
<Placing>:<Align>:<Column>    in a column with horizontal centers adjusted
<Placing>:<Align>:<Bottom>    in a bottom-adjusted row
<Placing>:<Align>:<Top>       in a top-adjusted row
<Placing>:<Align>:<Row>       in a row with vertical centers adjusted

<Placing>:<Align>:<Circle>    in a projection fashion on a circle. The user
  is requested to drag the mouse from the desired center to a point to be
  part of the circle itself.

WARNING: the automatic "spring" vertice placing (an algorithm which
 minimizes attraction/repulsion numerical functions in between states)
 is not wired in yet.
