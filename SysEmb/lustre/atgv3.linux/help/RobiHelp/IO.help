   Autograph writes and reads files in a dedicated
format, easily parsed and produced. Files are
usually suffixed in ".sa" Unix names. Automata with
missing graphical assignments may be loaded, 
providing "unexplored" states. See help:explore.

Files:load    -prompts for a file name in a dialog 
            window, and will create a new window.
Files:save    -requires an additional mouse click in
            each window whose contend is to be saved.
Files:save as -additional prompts for a file name to
            save the description.

   Postscript files may also be produced, ALTHOUGH
NOT READ BACK, including a %%BoundingBox value
allowing later inclusions. Drawings are not scaled 
in any way to fit page sizes.

WARNING: Not yet implemented:
A file browser for fast load/save.
Networks exploration.
Translation to more semantic FC2 format files
   (developped inside ESPRIT BRA CONCUR2 project).
Correctness and completion menus to check drawings.
