Show Label / Show Objetc : 
   The used color is the hilight color of the Name/Objetc but the
   combinaison mode is Xor, so the effective color is not predictable.

Select :
   Select Object (resp. Label) will deselect Label (resp. Object).
      
Delete Window :
   Delete a Window by the window manager is not actually handle by
   Autograph and may cause bus error problem.

Load Automaton to Explore :
   The initial vertex need a position and its name too.

Load Fc2 :             --- debugging version ---
   When a label reference in an fc2 file refers to a "hole" of the
   corresponding table, we build a dummy label ("BEWARE_DUMMY_LABEL") and
   we display the fc2 file.
