   Windows are drawing areas. 
They are created by the window:create menu, with
fixed size under the X11 resources:
   Atg*windowwidth
   Atg*windowwidth

   The drawing area is usually larger than the window
frame itself, so windows are entitled with scrollbars.
The drawing area can be further enlarged to bottom or
right directions by further creations and moves of 
objects. Drawing size is initially set to resources:
   Atg*drawingwidth
   Atg*drawingheight

   Non-orthogonal shifts are also permitted, using the
window:changeView menu function. Dragging the mouse
(left button) will then provide  a translate vector
of a given direction and length.

    The window:AdjustSize menu function will try to 
change the window size to fit the drawing area.
Minimal and maximal bounds for window resize
are provided as:
   Atg*windowminwidth
   Atg*windowminheight
   Atg*windowmaxwidth
   Atg*windowmaxheight

   the Window:globalView menu function provides
(limited) display of large drawings in auxiliary
windows, when clicking inside a regular window. 
Objects are scaled down, and labels are not 
displayed. Unexplored vertice are highlighted. The 
only function applicable to such global windows 
results of a mouse click indicating a new upper left 
corner for the window frame of the associated regular 
window, resulting in a shift of drawing.
Minimal and maximal bounds for global view windows
are provided as:
   Atg*globalwindowminwidth
   Atg*globalwindowminheight
   Atg*globalwindowmaxwidth
   Atg*globalwindowmaxheight

   Modular descriptions of process networks or 
reactive automata may be split in several windows,
with name links to instantiate subsystems inside 
other windows. Still, each window is treated 
independantly by Autograph, including translation.
The bindings should be made by later verification
engines using Autograph as a front-end.
