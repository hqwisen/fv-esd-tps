A "Net" is the graphical content of any Autograph window.

It contains boxes, vertice and webs, as well as ports on boxes
and edges linking vertice, ports and webs in a directional manner.
Finally all objects may bear labels, sorted in any of the 4 fields of
FC2 format: struct, behav, logic, hook. A net bears a name, in the
form of the window title (see menu button <Window>:<Title>).

Physical objects description is found in respective help files, with
the edition operations.

A net(work) may be correct or not, in structure. Correctness is only
checked prior  to translation into FC2 format. As an example, a net
with some transition joining two states included in different boxes is
incorrect. Correctness rules are described in the Autograph documentation.
