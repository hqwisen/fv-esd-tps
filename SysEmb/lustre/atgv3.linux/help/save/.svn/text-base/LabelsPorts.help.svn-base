Labels :
========




   Every graphic objects can be labelled. There are 4 types of labels,
struct, behav, logic and hook. 
For each object Labels are attached tedge semantic informations, which
may be applied to all objects. Edges may even be multiply labelled.

   A label consists of 4 (optional) fields, used to type its informational
  content: struct, behav, logic and hook field. They concern
  respectively: the process algebraic structure, the action behaviour
  structure, the logic model-checking info, and miscellaneous other
  typed info. 

   Each object type has a "most natural" default labelling field, in
  between struct (boxes, vertice) and behav (edges, ports, webs).

  How to create a label:
1- select either the <Label>:<create> or <Label>:<Default Create> menu
function, the second being a short way to assign only default fields.

2- Click on the object to be labelled with left mouse button.
3- Edit the label in the popped-up dialog widget, after selecting the
proper editing zone by clicking inside. In the <Label>:<create> case,
4 edition area are present, in the order: struct, behav, logic, hook.

   Labels fonts and colors depend on the type of object being
 labelled, according to X11 resources. See <Help>:<Attributes. 

   The <Label>:<SeeObject> menu function highlights the labelled
 object when clicking on the label. Conversely, the <Label>:<SeeLabel>
 menu function highlights the label decorating an object.
