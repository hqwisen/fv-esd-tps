Mouse buttons :
===============

   Autograph uses the three buttons of the mouse (left/middle/right).

The left button :
-----------------
   It select commands in menus and applies the selected command to the
clicked graphic objects. For example if you want to save drawings, you
select the "atg format" button in the "File" menu and you clic in
desired windows.

The middle button :
-------------------
   It is the global move of all graphics objects including labels.
When a current selection exists, moving a selected object will move
them all.

The right button :
------------------
   Select on and off graphic objects (box, vertex, and web only) in a
toggle fashion. You can select objects one by one by clicking inside.
You can surround the group of objects to select by clicking and
dragging the mouse (a rectangular shadow appear). By clicking outside
any object you remove all the selections.
