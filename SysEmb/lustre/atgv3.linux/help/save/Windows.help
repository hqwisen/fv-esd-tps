Window :
========

   The menu command <Window>:<Create> allows you to create shell
window. Horizontal and vertical scrollbars are automatically attached
to window when the drawing area become greather than the shell window.
Window size (normal, minimum and maximum), color (foreground and
background), title, ... are fixed by resources, like :

                    atg*windowTitle:     AtgWindow
                    atg*windowWidth:     300
                    atg*windowMinWidth:  100
                    atg*windowMaxWidth:  1000

   Classic manipulations of the window like move, resize, iconify, put
in front, put in back, ... must be done with your window manager. But
delete a window by the <Window>:<Delete (k)> menu command and retitle
it by <Window>:<title>.

   The <Window>:<Adjust Size (a)> menu command is used to adjust the
window size to the boundingbox of the drawing it contains.

   There is another way to move the window partial view on the window
global view than the scrollbars: the <Window>:<Move Partial view (i)>
menu command allows you to give by clicking and dragging the mouse a
direction and a length, when you release the mouse button, the partial
view is translated.

   The <Window>:<Global View (g)> menu command provides the user with
the full view of its drawing whatever the size of the drawing. The
size of the graphic objects are reduce, labels and ports are not shown
and unexplored vertice are hilighted. It is very usefull for big
drawings. The global view appear in an auxiliary window. This window
hands only one command: the move of the partial view (symbolised by a
rectangle) on the global view. The minimal and maximal size of the
global window are provided by resources.

   The <Window>:<Check Drawing Coherency (c)> menu command is used to
check is the automaton contained in the window obey to some semantics
rules (like : the automaton had an initial state, ...).
