   Autograph allows objects selection (with the mouse right button),
or label selection (with the <Label>:<Select> menu button).

  Objects are (de)selected in a toggle fashion, either individually by clicking
 on the object, or inside a rectangular zone defined by dragging the mouse.

  Several menu functions will work on the selection as a whole when  applied
 to any of its components (move, color or font changes, etc). Other functions
 will only make sense when a selection is provided (alignments).
