Resources management :
======================

  A resource is a user-preference specification that controls
user-customizable elements of an application. The resource file "Atg"
contain all elements we thought a user may want to change. The user
must refer to this file for resources names.

  If you run autograph on a black and white screen, move the
"AtgBlackAndWhite" resource file in the "Atg" file.
