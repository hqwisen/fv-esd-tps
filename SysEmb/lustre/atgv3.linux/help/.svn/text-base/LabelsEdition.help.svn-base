Label :
=======

   Like in fc2 format graphic objects are labeled by four distinct
fields: struct(ure), behav(iour), logic and hook. Distinctive meanings
are explained in the Fc2 documentation (see help on fileformat Fc2).

Creating a Label :
------------------

   With the <Label>:<Create/Edit All> command (`4' as keyboard
short-hand) one can enter the 4 label fields for any object clicked
on. The label editor allows some emacs-like commands, including some
mouse functions.  Each field can be individually made visible or not
on the drawing for the current object. When labeling a non labelled
object, most recent editing values are inserted in editors by default.
When editing an already labeled object, its current labeling is
provided in the editor fields.

   The <Label>:<Create/Edit Default> menu allows fast edition of most
frequently used fields (then only one editor is provided). Boxes and
vertices are then labeled in the (process algebraic) struct field,
while ports, webs and edges are labeled in the (action) behav field.

   Label fonts and colors will depend on both the types of the label
and of the type of the object it labels. See help <Attributes>:<Color>.

   <Label>:<Show Label/Object> highlights objects or labels to show
their correspondance.

Editing a label :
-----------------

   As edges can be multiply labeled (each label having 4 field), to
modify an existing label, there is a <Label>:<Reedit> menu button to
select a label (and not an object) to be modified by edition. Also
<Label>:<Bufferize> simply brings an existing label (with all 4
fields) into the editor, where it can then be pasted on unlabeled
objects as the last default value.

Show/Hide Label :
-----------------

  A number of menu buttons allow you to hide or draw labels from
objects in the window according to label types (in struct, behav,
hook, logic or for all types).

Label visible/invisible during Exploration :
--------------------------------------------

   If you want to hide all the default labels during the exploration
use the <Label>:<All>:<Hide all> menu button. If you want then to
restore the default label use the <Label>:<All>:<Restore> menu buton.
