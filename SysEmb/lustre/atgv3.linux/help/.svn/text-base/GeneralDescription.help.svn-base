General description :
=====================

   Autograph is a graphical front-end interface containing editor,
object management and translator features for automata networks in the
scope of process calculi theory.

User interface :
----------------
   Edition functions are found in the menubar and applied to graphical
area windows by mouse clicking. Dedicated text editors allow "semantic"
labeling such as names of behaviours and communications. See relevant
help on <Mouse Button>, <Windows> and further editing topics.

Graphic Objects :
-----------------
   Known objects are boxes, ports (on them), vertices, edges and webs.
Together they build automata networks. Objects can be labeled, and
labels are further refined according to meaning, amongst four fields:
structure, behaviour, logic, hook.

Autograph offers classical features of graphical editors (create,
move, delete, select on objects, cut-and-paste, alignment features, ...)
and also some domain-specific functions. See further help on <ObjectsEdit>,
<Placing> and <Attributes> for more details.

Input/output formats :
----------------------
   Autograph uses a private graphical format, an exchange format for
automata network descriptions, and postscript as an output.
See help on <Files> for more precise presentation of file formats.

Visualisation :
---------------
   Apart from graphical edition, Autograph is meant to display results
 from verification tools. The current version supports only automaton
 exploration in this regard. See help on <Placing:Exploration>.
