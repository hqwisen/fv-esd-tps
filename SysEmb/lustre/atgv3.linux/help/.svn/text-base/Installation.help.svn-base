Installation :
==============

The atg distrib contains :

   - the makefile, by running "make atg" you obtain a shell script named "atg",

   - the atg man pages,

   - the "atgbinary" binary file,

   - the resources file named "Atg", in the atg shell script, we set the shell
     variable XENVIRONMENT to this file,

   - a resource file named "AtgBlackAndWhite" for black and white screen to
     move in the "Atg" file when needed,

   - the "help" directory, in the atg shell script, we set the shell variable 
     ATG_HELP_DIR to this file. Path address can also be set in the Atg
     resource file as "atg*helpDir",

   - the shell command "psfp" and its man pages, for full page display of
     autograph postscript output,

   - the "sa2atg" binary used to translate all old ".sa" syntax into new ".atg"
     syntax,

   - the fc2 reference manual,

   - the XKeysymDB file: to avoid error message like
   <Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: .../...>,
     in the atg shell script, we set the shell variable XKEYSYMDB to
     this file.
