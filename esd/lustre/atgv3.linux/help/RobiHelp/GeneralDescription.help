    Autograph is a graphical editor and display support for
communicating systems and reactive automata, in the framework
of process algebra theory (CCS, Meije, Lotos and other 
relevant calculi, see help:translation).

    Descriptions may be edited using the following types of
objects: boxes   (processes)
         ports   (communication end-points)
         vertice (dynamic automata states)
         edges   (automata transitions and port connections)
         "webs"  (multisynchronisations)
         labels  (tagging other objects)
See help:editing and help:labels for more details.

    Autograph fronts the user with a menubar, displaying
several menus: 
   help      (dividing further in topics)
   I/O file  (loading and saving, see help:system management)
   window    (create and and manage drawing areas, see
                                      help:system management)
   labels    (
   box       (     edition menus, see help:edition and
   port      (     help:labels.
   vertex    (
   web       (
   edge      (
   selection (sub-drawings manipulations, see 
                                help:system management)
   color     (changing the color of objects, see
                                help:system management)

   Autograph is mouse driven, with specific functions picked
from menus, bound to mouse buttons, and applied to editing
areas. See help:mouse for further details on buttons 
interpretation. 

   Edition in Autograph is non-structural: incorrect drawings
are permitted for draft purpose. Correctness itself depends
on the specific algebra and verification engine aimed at.
See help:translation.

   Autograph reads and writes descriptions (of process
networks and/or automata) in a dedicated format. Graphical
placements may be fully or partially omitted from this
descriptions, and interactive positioning from the user is
allowed (WARNING: Currently, only for automata). See
help:explore for more details.

   Apart from labels, which bear semantic informations onto
objects, other attributes may be applied graphically. Some
are dependant on the target calculus, some are Autograph
display, some are mere color highlights. See help:attributes
for more details.

   Autograph allows a selection mechanism, to apply functions
onto a set of objects at once. Examples are alignement
functions. See help:SelectAlign for more details.
