     Automata may be partially explored, specially
when loaded from files produced by verification tools.

     A vertex is "unexplored" when some of its outgoing
transitions are missing on display. Unexplored vertice
have specific graphical attributes.

     How to explore a vertex:
1- Select the Exploration:ExploreAutomata menu function.
2- click inside a given unexplored vertex, keeping the
   mouse button down, and drag to indicate a given
   direction and length. 

     New edges will be displayed "around" the given
direction,with possibly new vertice being unfolded. 
Exceptions are:
Edges leading to already existing vertice globally
point towards them.
Self-loops are displayed in the opposite directions to
other edges.

     Superposed edges are allowed, but Autograph will
try to the best of its knowledge not to superpose two
edges of OPPOSITE directions in between objects.

     Vertice may also be explored BACKWARDS, with the
Exploration:BackExploreAutomata menu function. A vertex
does NOT indicate whether it is fully backward explored.

     Vertice and edges can also be folded back, using
the Explore:Unexplore menu function. Then clicking 
indistinctly on vertice and edges will fold them back
out of display, to the extension that a connected part
cannot be fully removed from display (it could not be
retrieved later on).

     Automatic placement is also possible, through
the Explore:Spring menu function. Click inside a given
vertex afterwards. As a result a new window is popped up,
containing an automatically placed version of the
automaton comprising this vertex. The function uses an
independant software tool, used courtesy of the LRI
(Paris 11 University, Orsay, France). See help:copyright
for details.

WARNING: Exploration of networks other than automata
         is not yet implemented.
