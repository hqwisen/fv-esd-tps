 The <Placing>:<Backward Explore> menu allows unfolding of all
 unexplored edges leading to a prescribed vertex.

 To explore a vertex backward, just:

-first,  click down inside the desired vertex;
-second, release the mouse button to give the main general direction.

New states shall be dispersed in a quadrant obeying this direction.
