  autograph is written in C++. The graphic is supported by the XWindow
library (Xlib), the Intrinsics toolkit (Xt) and the Osf Motif widget
library (Xm).

   Xlib is the lowest level of programming interface in X and deal
with the window drawing area. Xt is part of the X standard which
defines routines for building and using widgets. Together OsfMotif and
Xt provide menu and window environments (menubar, dialog boxes,
scrolled window, window drawing area, ...).
