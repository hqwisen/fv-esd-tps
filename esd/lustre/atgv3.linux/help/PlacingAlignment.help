Alignment :
===========

   Selected objects can be aligned according to different shapes:
      <Placing>:<Align>:<Left>   
      <Placing>:<Align>:<Right>  
      <Placing>:<Align>:<Column> (vertically centered)
      <Placing>:<Align>:<Bottom> 
      <Placing>:<Align>:<Top>    
      <Placing>:<Align>:<Row>    (horizontally centered)
      <Placing>:<Align>:<Circle> 

   For each of these commands a phantom shall appear when pulling the
 mouse button down, which can be moved and will figure the ruler
 against which objects shall be projected when releasing the button.
 In case of <Circle>, the initial click figures the center and the
 place of release indicates the radius. Objects will be slid from
 their current position on the half-line rooted in the circle center
 until they reach the circle itself (circular projection).
