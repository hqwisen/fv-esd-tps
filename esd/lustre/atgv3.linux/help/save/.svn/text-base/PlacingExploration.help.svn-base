Exploration :
=============

   The present version of autograph focus on automata (as they are the
main results of verification system). Most of the time, they present
no graphic positions for their vertices, edges and labels. The
exploration allow you to display these automata. There are two ways to
do this, you can unfold the automaton step by step by exploring the
vertex adjacency list with the <Placing>:<Explore (E)> menu command,
or display the whole automaton or a given part of it, in one step with
the <Placing>:<Vertex Automatic> menu command (this command is not yet
implemented).
   A vertex is said to be unexplored when some of its outgoing edges
are missing on display. Unexplored vertice have specific graphical
attributes. To explore a vertex, once the explore command selected,
click inside an unexplored vertex, keep the mouse button down, and
drag to indicate a given direction and length. When you release the
mouse button, new edges will be displayed "around" the given
direction, with possibly new vertice being unfolded. Edges leading to
already existing vertice point towards them. Loop edges are displayed
in the opposite directions to other edges.

   Vertice may also be explored backwards (its ingoing edges will be
displayed) with the <Placing>:<Explore Backward> menu command. A
vertex does not indicate whether it is fully backward explored.

   The <Placing>:<Unexplore (U)> menu command allows you to refold
either vertice or edges, out of drawing.
