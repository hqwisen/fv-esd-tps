Checking and Translation :
==========================

  	  Drawings are translated into Fc2 format, provided they
fulfill coherency requirements. Incorrections are listed on the
standard error when using the <Window>:<check coherency> menu button
or directly when translating in fc2 format.

Fc2 Format for Graphic Object Label :
=====================================

   If graphic object labels are not edited inside character string,
they are parsed like fc2 expression where leaves are strings and
operators are for example ^, ~, _, @, &, ), ,, ., !, >, <, (, +, ?, :,
*, #.

   By default identificators are put inside character string BUT
BEWARE tau (Tau, TAU) is an fc2 identificator (like quit,  so il you
whish a "tau" ("Tau", "TAU") write it inside character string.

 See the fc2 reference manual for help.

  For example, when you edit a behav label :

     1)  !a+?b.TAU      is equivalent to    ! "a" + ? "b" . tau

             It will become in the fc2 format something like :
             Behavs 3
                :0   "a"
                :1   "b"
                :3   !0+?1.tau


     2) !"a+?b"."TAU"  is equivalent to    ! "a+?b" . "TAU"

            It will become in the fc2 format something like :
               Behavs 2
                  :0   "a+?b"
                  :1   "TAU"
                  :2   !0.1
