General description :
=====================

   Autograph is devoted to edition, manipulation and translation in
different formats of automata networks. It is adapted to graphic
representations of semantic information in the field of process
calculi.

   Edition functions are found in the menubar and apply on graphic
objects by clicking inside. It exists Keyboard shortcuts for the
mostly often used functions. The shorcuts are given between
parenthesis in menu button labels.

Input/output formats :
----------------------
   There are two input/output formats: an internal format for saving
and reloading the edited drawings (file suffixed by ".atg"), and the
fc format for their semantic description (file suffixed by ".fc2"). A
drawing is translated in the fc format whether it has been first
checked correct for some coherency rules.

   There is a third output format, the postscript format (file
suffixed by ".ps"), used for listing and inclusions in latex files.

Graphic Objects :
-----------------
   Edition and manipulation offer classic functions you await from a
graphic tool (structural move, global views, cut and paste facilities,
undo command, alignments ...).
   It deal with the following graphic objects: box representing
processes, port on boxes for inter-process communications, vertex for
automata states, edge for process connections and automata
transitions, and web for multiple connections.

   In the fc format, objects are described by four fields: struct
(stands for structural), behav (for behavioral), logic (for logical)
and hook (is used to attach additional information to objects, like
color, type, position, ...). Graphic objects can be labeled according
to the four previous types. Each graphic object has a default label
type: struct for box and vertex, behav for edge, port and web. Fonts
depend on both the types of the label and the object it labels.
   Graphic objects, including labels, have a standard color foreground
and background.

Visualisation :
---------------
   Autograph is mainly used to display verification results coming
from external tools. This version deal only with automaton. It permits
to give placements to automaton containing no graphic positions for
their vertice, edges and labels. You can do it either step by step or
in one step (based upon the spring algorithm).
