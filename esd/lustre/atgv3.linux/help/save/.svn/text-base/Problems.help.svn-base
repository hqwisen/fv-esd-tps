   ===========================================================

Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: .../...
-------------------------------------------------------------
   If you get this error message while running atg, set the shell
variable XKEYSYMDB to the XKeysymDB file of the atg distrib and rerun
atg.


Rubberband :
------------
If the rubberband (dashed rectangle which appear when you move an
object) is not visible or if the color is too light, you can try to
set the two following resources with different colors :
            atg*rubberForeground: DimGray
            atg*rubberBackground: Black


<Label>:<Show Label/Object> : 
-----------------------------
   The used color is the hilight color of the Name/Objetc but the
combinaison mode is Xor, so the effective color is not predictable.


<Windows>:<Delete (k)> :
------------------------
   Delete a Window by the window manager is not actually handle by
Autograph and may cause bus error problem.


<Files>:<Load Fc2 (f)> :
------------------------
                        --- debugging version ---
   When a label reference in an fc2 file refers to a "hole" of the
corresponding table, we build a dummy label ("BEWARE_DUMMY_LABEL") and
we display the fc2 file.


<Help>:
-------
    The first time atg display a Motif widget, its size is bad.
