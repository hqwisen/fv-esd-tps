Mouse buttons :
===============

  Autograph distinguishes between left/middle/right mouse button.

The left button :
-----------------
   Allows all functions. Selects commands from menu buttons and then
applies them repeatedly. It is always imperative to click on these
objects or areas to which the function is to be applied.

The middle button :
-------------------
 Is a short-hand for move commands on all objects or labels (or selection, 
see below).

The right button :
------------------
  Is a short-hand for the <Globals>:<Select> command.  Grouping
objects by selection allows them to be applied further commands as a
whole ("copy" for instance). Individual objects are
selected/deselected in a toggle mode fashion through this mouse
button. Rectangular regions can also be toggled by dragging the mouse
with this button down.
