   ===================================

Rubberband :
------------
If the rubberband (dashed rectangle which appear when you move an
object) is not visible or if the color is too light, you can try to
set the two following resources with different colors :
            atg*rubberForeground: DimGray
            atg*rubberBackground: Black


<Label>:<Show Label/Object> : 
-----------------------------
   The used color is the hilight color of the Name/Objetc but the
combinaison mode is Xor, so the effective color is not predictable.


<Windows>:<Delete (k)> :
------------------------
   Delete a Window by the window manager is not actually handle by
Autograph and may cause bus error problem.


<Files>:<Load Fc2 (f)> :
------------------------
                        --- debugging version ---
   When a label reference in an fc2 file refers to a "hole" of the
corresponding table, we create a dummy label : "Unknown_Label" and
we load the fc2 file.
