Exploration :
=============

   Autograph allows parts of some automata to be hidden, not
displayed.  This is typically the case for fc2 automata files coming
from verification systems. Such invisible automata can be -fully or
partially- interactively explored by the user, using the
<Placing>:<Explore> menu button (`x' for keyboard short-hand).

   A (visible) state whose outgoing edges are not all visible is
decorated with a smaller circle inside its shape (it is said to be
"non fully explored"). To explore its invisible transition one clicks
inside the state, leaving the mouse button down, and release the
button at a location providing a main dircetion together with a
distance. New reached states, or intermediate nails for edges leading
to existing states, are then placed in a quadrant around the main
direction and at integer multiple distances of the one provided. New
states shall again be unexplored, so that this function unfolds
automata one step at a time.

   Vertice may also be explored backwards with <Placing>:<Explore Back (X)>
(considering incoming edges).  Still, a vertex bears the "unexplored"
tag exactly until explored forwards.

   The <Placing>:<Unexplore (U)> menu command allows to fold back
both vertice or edges for screen management and clarity.

Highlighting unexplored vertice during exploration :
----------------------------------------------------
  The <Window>:<See/Hide Global View> provides you a scaled view of
the window (you clic on) where the unexplored vertices are
highlighted. If you clic in this global view window, you can move a
rectangular box to change the current view of the edition window. See
<Help>:<Window>.

Hiding Label during exploration :
-------------------------------
  When labels darken the screen, you can hide it all using
<Label>:<All>:<Hide all>. Labels remain unvisible until you use
<Label>:<All>:<Restore>, which display the default label of all
objects.
