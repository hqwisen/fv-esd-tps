.SH NAME
sscblif \- Esterel  blif code producer for Esterel v5_21

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sscblif [options] 
.I file.ssc

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B sscblif
code producer takes as input a circuit described in 
.I ssc 
format (Sorted Soft Code Format) and translates it into a circuit
described in 
.I blif
(Berkeley Logic Interchange Format). 
When used without any options, 
.B sscblif
only translates circuits generated from Pure Esterel programs with
possible counters.
With \-soft option circuits from Full Esterel programs are accepted.
The result is a circuit describing the control of the
program. It may be used by the 
.B blifssc
processor to generate optimized
.I ssc
code.
The produced circuits may be optimized (see option -O). In that case,
.B sscblif
calls
.B blifopt-1.2.
This program will call the optimizer 
.B sis-1.2. 
The user can use his/her own optimizer by setting the shell 
.B SSCBLIF_OPT
variable to the new program name. 
.B sscblif
will call this new one instead of
.B blifopt-1.2. 
The options must be the same.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-version
Print the version name on the standard output stream and terminate,
ignoring all other arguments.
.TP 8
.B \-access 
Print various informations about the compilation of the processor on
the standard output stream and terminate, ignoring all other arguments.
.TP 8
.B \-info     
Print various  informations  about  the  processor
compilation  on  the  standard error output stream
and terminate, ignoring all other arguments.
.TP 8
.B \-s
Silent mode. No output is generated.
.TP 8
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
.TP 8
.BI \-B " name"
.sp 0
name denotes the output file base name, The suffix ".opt.blif" is added
automatically. If this option and the \-D option are omitted, the name
.I sscblif_out.opt.blif 
is used. 
.TP 8
.BI \-D " directory"
Specifies a directory where the output file(s) will be placed. The
default is the current directory.
.TP 8
.B \-hierarchy
Decompose the circuit into subcircuits. Use this option to
optimize large circuits.
.TP 8
.B \-K
Keeps intermediate files.
.TP 8
.B \-O
Call the optimizer. Default optimizations improves speed of Pure
Esterel programs and improves area in case of control extraction (see
-soft option). Optimizations can be controlled with the following
options:
.RS 8
.TP 8
.B \-area
Optimizes using area optimization.
.TP 8
.B \-h_speed
Optimizes using speed optimization only.
.TP 8
.B \-speed
Optimizes using speed optimization and performs technology mapping to Xilinx.
.TP 8
.B \-script 
.I filename
.br
Specify to use the file
.I filename
as optimization script. The name of the script must be a full file
name. See 
.B sis(1) 
for writing scripts.
.RE
.TP 8
.B \-soft
Specify to extract the control of the circuit.
.TP 8
.B \-makefile
\fBsscblif\fR produces a makefile when optimization is run and deletes
it unless the \-K option is specified. The \-makefile option allows to
obtain this makefile without running the optimization.
.TP 8
.B \-w
suppress any warning.
.TP 8
.B \-W
print out any warning.



.SH EXAMPLES
If foo.ssc is generated from a Pure Esterel program, the command:
.RS
sscblif foo.ssc -B foo
.RE
produce the file foo.blif. If the original program contains static
counters (ie counters with a known value at compile time, such as
\fIawait 4 I\fR), then two files are produced:
.TP 8
.I foo.ctl.blif
this file contains the program control.
.TP 8
.I foo.blif
this is the main circuit that contains the description of the needed
counters and the call to the program control circuit.
.PP
If foo.ssc is generated from a general Esterel program, then sscblif
can only extracts the program control logic. It must be called as
follows:
.RS
sscblif -soft foo.ssc
.RE
In this case, two files are generated:
.TP 8
.I foo.blif
the actual circuit from the program control.
.TP 8
.I foo.ctbl
this file describes the dependencies between the actions within the
Esterel program and will be used when rebuild a .ssc file from a .blif
file. See blifssc(1).
.PP
The command:
.RS
sscblif -O foo.ssc -B foo
.RE
will produce an optimized circuit always in the file foo.opt.blif.

Finally, assuming that foo.ssc is generated from a Full Esterel
program, the following command:
.RS
sscblif foo.ssc -B foo -soft -hierarchy -O -script /tmp/foo.script
.RE
will extract the control of the circuit and decompose it in
sub-circuits. Each sub-circuit will be optimized using the
user script /tmp/foo.script. 

.SH BUGS
\fBinputoutput\fR signals receive a special treatment since an
\fBinputoutput\fR wire cannot be expressed in \fBblif\fR. Thus, for
each \fBinputoutput\fR signal, say X, two wires are generated: one
for the input and one for the output. The naming convention is as
follow: the input wire is named \fBX_IO_I\fR while the output signal is
named \fBX_IO_O\fR. Be careful to not already have  a signal with one
of this name since no checks are performed.


.SH FILES
A make file is generated when optimizing. The base name of this file
depends on the \-B option and its suffix is \.make. With \-soft option
another file is generated with suffix \.ctbl. This file will be used
by the
.B blifssc
processor.
